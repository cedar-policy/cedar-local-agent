# Cedar Local Agent

This crate is experimental.

The `cedar-local-agent` crate provides customers a useful foundation for creating asynchronous authorizers that
can handle two different operational modes:

1. The authorizer is **able** to cache all of your applicationâ€™s policies and entity data while evaluating a request
2. The authorizer is **unable** to cache all of your application's policies and entity data while evaluating a request

The `cedar-local-agent` crate provides a [`simple::Authorizer`](./src/public/simple.rs) which can be built with option (1) or (2).  The
[`simple::Authorizer`](./src/public/simple.rs) is constructed using policy and entity providers.  These providers can be
implemented by customers.

`cedar-local-agent` provides sample implementations of providers that implement option (1).  A file system policy set provider: 
[`file::PolicySetProvider`](./src/public/file/policy_set_provider.rs), and an entity provider: 
[`file::EntityProvider`](./src/public/file/entity_provider.rs).

For more information about the Cedar language/project, please take a look
at [cedarpolicy.com](https://www.cedarpolicy.com).

## Usage

Cedar Local Agent can be used in your application via the `cedar-local-agent` crate.

Add `cedar-local-agent` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file. For example:

```toml
[dependencies]
cedar-local-agent = "0.1"
```

## Quick Start

Build a local authorizer that evaluates authorization decisions using a locally stored
policy set, entity store and schema.

Policy data: [`tests/data/sweets.cedar`](./tests/data/sweets.cedar)

Entity data: [`tests/data/sweets.entities.json`](./tests/data/sweets.entities.json)

Schema: [`tests/data/sweets.schema.cedar.json`](./tests/data/sweets.schema.cedar.json)

Build a policy set:

```rust
let policy_set_provider = PolicySetProvider::new(
    policy_set_provider::ConfigBuilder::default()
        .policy_set_path("tests/data/sweets.cedar")
        .build()
        .unwrap(),
)
.unwrap();
```

Build an entity provider:

```rust
let entity_provider = EntityProvider::new(
    entity_provider::ConfigBuilder::default()
        .entities_path("tests/data/sweets.entities.json")
        .schema_path("tests/data/sweets.schema.cedar.json")
        .build()
        .unwrap(),
)
.unwrap();
```

Build the authorizer:

```rust
let authorizer: Authorizer<PolicySetProvider, EntityProvider> = Authorizer::new(
    AuthorizerConfigBuilder::default()
        .entity_provider(Arc::new(entity_provider))
        .policy_set_provider(Arc::new(policy_set_provider))
        .build()
        .unwrap(),
);
```

Evaluate a decision:

```rust
assert_eq!(
    authorizer
        .is_authorized(&Request::new(
            Some(format!("User::\"Cedar\"").parse().unwrap()),
            Some(format!("Action::\"read\"").parse().unwrap()),
            Some(format!("Box::\"3\"").parse().unwrap()),
            Context::empty(),
        ), &Entities::empty())
        .await
        .unwrap()
        .decision(),
    Decision::Deny
)
```

## [`simple::Authorizer`](./src/public/simple.rs) `is_authorized` API Semantics

The [`simple::Authorizer`](./src/public/simple.rs) `is_authorized` API takes a 
[`Cedar request`](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar/tree/main/cedar-policy)
and [`Cedar entities`](https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar/tree/main/cedar-policy) within the API.  

```rust
pub async fn is_authorized(
    &self,
    request: &Request,
    entities: &Entities,
) -> Result<Response, AuthorizerError> { ... }
```

For scenarios where the same entity identifier, `EID`, is passed as input and returned by an `EntityProvider`, the input is
considered the last value. This API favors last-value-wins semantics.
This behavior is subject to change pending [`RFC-0020`](https://github.com/cedar-policy/rfcs/blob/main/text/0020-unique-record-keys.md).

## Updating [`file::PolicySetProvider`](./src/public/file/policy_set_provider.rs) or [`file::EntityProvider`](./src/public/file/entity_provider.rs) data

The [`file::PolicySetProvider`](./src/public/file/policy_set_provider.rs) and [`file::EntityProvider`](./src/public/file/entity_provider.rs)
gather data when initialized and cache it in memory. No data is read from disk during an authorization decision.

Policy and entity data can be mutated on disk after the initialization of an authorizer. To account for this, functionality
is provided which will refresh policy and entity data tangential to an authorization decision.
To accomplish this a minimum of two additional threads are required, for a total of three threads.

1. The main thread handles `is_authorized` calls
2. The signaler thread notifies receivers of required updates
3. The receiver thread listens for updates

[`Channels`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/channels.html) are used to communicate between the signaler thread and 
the receiver thread. There are two provided functions for creating signaler threads. Both return a signaler thread and a
[`tokio::broadcast::receiver`](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/sync/broadcast/struct.Receiver.html) as an output.

1. [`clock_ticker_task`](./src/public/events/core.rs) periodically wakes up and signals based on a clock duration
2. [`file_inspector_task`](./src/public/events/core.rs) periodically wakes up and checks for differences in a file 
using a collision resistant hashing function (SHA256) and notifies on modifications

Receivers are required to be passed to a new separate thread to listen and respond to events.
The [`update_provider_data_task`](./src/public/events/receive.rs) handles receiving these signals in the form of an
[`Event`](./src/public/events/mod.rs).  Messages are handled one message at a time.  The receiver thread blocks until 
it has successfully or unsuccessfully updated the data for the provider. 

Sample usage of updating a policy set provider's data every sixty seconds:

```rust
let (clock_ticker_signal_thread, receiver) = clock_ticker_task(Duration::from_secs(60));

let policy_set_provider = Arc::new(PolicySetProvider::new(
    policy_set_provider::ConfigBuilder::default()
        .policy_set_path("tests/data/sweets.cedar")
        .build()
        .unwrap(),
)
.unwrap());

let update_provider_thread = update_provider_data_task(policy_set_provider.clone(), receiver);
```

Note: these background threads must remain in scope for the life of your application.  If there is an issue updating
in a background thread it will produce an `error!()` message but will not cause the application to crash.

## Tracing

This crate emits trace data [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/) and can be integrated 
into standard tracing implementations.

## Authorization Logging

Authorization logs are designed to power detection and response capabilities. Sample capabilities can be found 
under the [`Mitre D3fend matrix`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/), 
for example [`User Behavioral Analysis`](https://d3fend.mitre.org/technique/d3f:UserBehaviorAnalysis/).

The authorizer's provided emit authorization events as [`tracing events`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/struct.Event.html). 
Authorization events are included in tracing [`spans`](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/span/index.html). 
Authorization events are default formatted using [`Open Cyber Security Format`](https://github.com/ocsf).
Authorization events can optionally be filtered, formatted and routed directly to an authorization log. See example:

```rust
// Dependencies must be included in the `Cargo.toml` file of the application
// tracing, tracing-appender, tracing-subscriber

let authorization_roller = tracing_appender::rolling::minutely("logs", "authorization.log");
let (authorization_non_blocking, _guard) = tracing_appender::non_blocking(authorization_roller);
let authorization_log_layer = tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer()
    .event_format(AuthorizerFormatter(AuthorizerTarget::Simple))
    .with_writer(authorization_non_blocking);
tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(authorization_log_layer)
    .try_init()
    .expect("Logging Failed to Start, Exiting.");
```

To filter authorization event logs, provide a log config to the authorizer with a `FieldSet` which includes the fields that are to be logged. By default if not explicitly configured, no fields will be logged.

Sample usage of logging everything within the authorization request:
```rust
let log_config = 
    log::ConfigBuilder::default()
        .field_set(log::FieldSetBuilder::default()
            .principal(true)
            .action(true)
            .resource(true)
            .context(true)
            .entities(log::FieldLevel::All)
            .build()
            .unwrap())
    .build()
    .unwrap();

let authorizer: Authorizer<PolicySetProvider, EntityProvider> = Authorizer::new(
    AuthorizerConfigBuilder::default()
        .entity_provider(...)
        .policy_set_provider(...)
        .log_config(log_config)
        .build()
        .unwrap(),
);
```
### Note:

Cedar does not at this time support extracting the `Context` from the `Request` struct since it is private, therefore it is extracted using `request.to_string()`. This is not ideal as this logs the entire request (Principal, Action, Resource, Context) instead of just the context. 

In particular this brings two quirks:
- If the `FieldSet` has principal and context set to true, then the resulting log will include the principal twice.
- If the `FieldSet` has principal set to false and context set to true, then the resulting log will include principal anyway since it is included in the `request.to_string()` call required to extract the context.


The above are not specific to principal and also occur with action and resource. A cedar github issue has been created to add a getter for the context on the cedar Request struct that will fix this: https://github.com/cedar-policy/cedar/issues/363

## Example application

This project is based on a fictitious application that allows users to manage sweet boxes. There are two entities:

1. Box (Resource)
2. User (Principal)

There are two user entities:

1. Eric
2. Mike

There are ten resources, `Box`. Each box has an entity identifier (id) that ranges 
between the numbers 1-10. Each `Box` has one attribute `owner`. The owners of each `Box` are defined in 
the [`tests/data/sweets.entities.json`](./tests/data/sweets.entities.json) file, 
this file represents the complete database of information for this application.

The actions that `Users` can perform on each `Box` are defined in the schema file:
[`tests/data/sweets.schema.cedar.json`](./tests/data/sweets.schema.cedar.json). To summarize, each `User`
can perform one of the following actions `read`, `update` or `delete` on a `Box` resource.

A policy is a statement that declares which `Users` are explicitly permitted, or explicitly forbidden to perform an 
action on a resource, `Box`. Here is a sample policy:

```
@id("owner-policy")
permit(principal, action, resource)
when { principal == resource.owner };
```

Refer to [`tests/data/sweets.cedar`](./tests/data/sweets.cedar) for the full details of these policies. 
This file represents all policies for this application.

Given the `schema`, `entities` and `policy_set` the application can use the `Authorizer` as provided in the usage above. 
Here is a sample request and expected outcome:

```rust
 assert_eq!(
     authorizer
         .is_authorized(&Request::new(
             Some(format!("User::\"Mike\"").parse().unwrap()),
             Some(format!("Action::\"read\"").parse().unwrap()),
             Some(format!("Box::\"3\"").parse().unwrap()),
             Context::empty(),
         ), &Entities::empty())
         .await
         .unwrap()
         .decision(),
     Decision::Deny
 );
 assert_eq!(
     authorizer
         .is_authorized(&Request::new(
             Some(format!("User::\"Mike\"").parse().unwrap()),
             Some(format!("Action::\"read\"").parse().unwrap()),
             Some(format!("Box::\"2\"").parse().unwrap()),
             Context::empty(),
         ), &Entities::empty())
         .await
         .unwrap()
         .decision(),
     Decision::Allow
 );
```
